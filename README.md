404 Redirect
====================

Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org). 

Description
-----------
A simple plugin that will set the 404 header if the link ID is unknown.
This was made due to the weird configs I have on my nginx install which caused nginx not to give a 404 error page but just a blank white page.


Installation
------------
1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `404-redirect`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Plugins administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php` ) and activate the plugin.
4. Add " define( 'CON_404_PAGE', '/* Path to error page from webserver root*/' ); " to config.php
Example:
" define( 'CON_404_PAGE', 'errorpages/404.html' ); "
4. Have fun!
